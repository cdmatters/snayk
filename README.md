snayk
=====

Snayk is an implementation of the game `Snake' in pure JavaScript, but using polar eigenvectors as the basic movement controls instead of standard cartesians ones. It also accesses local storage to save high scores.

It was written as real introduction to javascript, and I am indebted to Eloquent Javascript by Marijn Haverbeke and Mary Rose Cook's seminar on Game Development at the Recurse Centre.
